<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was created as a pedagogical library to teach the undergraduate students in the Systems and Computer Engineer program at Universidad de los Andes and others in the faculty to use and understand data structures and its related algorithm. This includes Arrays, Lists, Maps, Ordered Maps, Binary Search Trees (BST), Red Black Trees (RBT) and Graphs.

**IMPORTANT** This is a work in progress. The project is mainly focused as a teaching tool for undergraduate college students and is not intended to be used as a full-functional library.

<!-- BUILT WITH -->
### Implementation

This library was built with the following technologies:
  * `Mac OS` and `Windows 10` for operating system.
  * `VS code` for the IDE.
  * `Python 3.6` for the programming language.
  * `Pytest` for the testing framework.

As a design principle **DISClib** minimize the use of Python external libraries in its implementation.

Finally, **DISClib** works between `Python 3.6` and `Python 3.9` versions.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This section contains the steps to get started with the library. As is the case with any other library, you need to install the library and then import it in your project.

As the library is not Object Oriented, you need to import the library in your project as a module using the following steps in [Installation](#installation).

[Back to top](#disclib)

<!-- PREREQUISITES -->
### Prerequisites

As a design principle **DISClib** minimize the use of Python external libraries in its implementation.

To execute the tests in the `Test` folder, you need to install the `Pytest` package.

  ```bash
  pip install pytest
  ```

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
### Installation

For the moment the **DISClib** is available as a local dependency in your project. To install it you can follow the next steps:

1. Create a new project folder.
1. Clone the repo with the command:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ISIS1225DEVS/ISIS1225-Lib.git
   ```

1. Move the **DISClib** folder to the project folder.
1. Create a new Python file in the project folder.
1. Import the necessary **DISClib** ADT modules into your project with the command:

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
The Road so far led us to complete the following features:

* [ ] To include examples for all modules in the repository [Demo and Examples][demo-url].
* [ ] To clean some code and make it more readable.
* [ ] To standardize the functions and variables names throughout the library.
* [ ] To improve the library the documentation.
* [ ] To implement the Adjacency Matrix data structure for the ADT Graph.

See the [open issues][issues-url] for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
